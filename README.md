In this study, we executed a CNN architecture for classification of dermatoscopic Images some of them are InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB3, etc. and also used SVM classifiers like SVM-C using BoVW for classification. We are used the dataset images which is provided by International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), a global partnership that has organized the world's largest public repository of dermatoscopic images of skin or use HAM10000 dataset. Our project is divided into three parts: For Part 1 Segmentation of images is done using Hybrid ACO-GA. For Part 2 Feature Extraction/ Attribute detection For Part 3 Disease Classification using SVM Classifiers like SVM-C using TSVM classifier and comparison with CNN architectures.
